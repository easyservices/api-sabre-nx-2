## üîó Seamless Integration with Nextcloud through REST/JSON APIs

Our custom-developed solution exposes Nextcloud‚Äôs CalDAV and CardDAV interfaces as modern, developer-friendly REST/JSON APIs, enabling seamless integration with virtually any application, regardless of platform or language.

No more dealing with legacy protocols ‚Äî developers can now access, create, or update calendar events and contact records using simple HTTP requests and standard JSON payloads.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Benefits:

    üìÖ REST access to CalDAV: Read, create, update calendar events easily.

    üë• REST access to CardDAV: Manage contacts in a fully interoperable way.

    üîó Easy integration: Works with any REST-capable system (CRMs, ERPs, bots...).

    üîê Secure and efficient: Built on top of Nextcloud‚Äôs robust auth and permission system.

üöÄ Empower your ecosystem

Whether you're developing business automation workflows, personal productivity tools, or AI assistants, this REST/JSON bridge opens up Nextcloud to a whole new world of integrations.

## Features

- REST API for contacts and events management
- Comprehensive CardDAV/CalDAV integration with Nextcloud
- Secure authentication handling
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Swagger UI documentation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

2. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The application requires configuration to connect to your Nextcloud instance. Look at the config.example.yaml file in the /src/api and /src/nextcloud directories. Rename them in config.yaml and edit them according to your needs.

## Usage

Run directly using the script:
```bash
python fastapi_server.py
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:<your port>` with the following endpoints:
- API Documentation: `http://localhost:<your port>/docs`
- Contacts API: `http://localhost:<your port>/contacts`
- Events API: `http://localhost:<your port>/events`
- Status: `http://localhost:<your port>/status`

## API Documentation

The API provides comprehensive endpoints for managing contacts and events in Nextcloud.

### Authentication

All API endpoints require HTTP Basic Authentication with your Nextcloud credentials.

## Testing
Run all tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Or run individual test modules:

```bash
# Test contacts directly with Nextcloud (no FastAPI server needed)
python -m tests.test_contacts_nx_cli

# Test events directly with Nextcloud (no FastAPI server needed)
python -m tests.test_events_nx_cli

# Test contacts via the FastAPI server (requires server to be running)
python -m tests.test_contacts_api_cli

# Test events via the FastAPI server (requires server to be running)
python -m tests.test_events_api_cli
```
